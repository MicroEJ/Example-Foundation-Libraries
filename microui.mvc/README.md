# Overview

This example shows how to create and use a MVC design pattern.

# Requirements

* MICROEJ SDK 6.
* A VEE Port that contains:
    * EDC-1.3 or higher.
    * BON-1.4 or higher.
    * MICROUI-3.4 or higher.

This example has been tested on:

* Android Studio with MicroEJ plugin for Android Studio 0.1.2.
* [STM32F7508-DK VEE Port 2.2.0.](https://github.com/MicroEJ/VEEPort-STMicroelectronics-STM32F7508-DK/tree/2.2.0)

# Usage

To interact with the demo, drag the point located at the intersection of the 3 rectangular areas.

By default, the sample will use the STM32F7508-DK VEE Port.

Refer to the [Select a VEE Port](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/selectVeePort.html) documentation for more information.

## Run on simulator

In Android Studio:
- Open the Gradle tool window by clicking on the elephant icon on the right side,
- Expand the `Tasks` list,
- From the `Tasks` list, expand the `microej` list,
- Double-click on `runOnSimulator`,
- The application starts, the traces are visible in the Run view.

Alternative ways to run in simulation are described in the [Run on Simulator](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/runOnSimulator.html) documentation.

## Run on device

Make sure to properly setup the VEE Port environment before going further.
Refer to the VEE Port README for more information.

In Android Studio:
- Open the Gradle tool window by clicking on the elephant on the right side,
- Expand the `Tasks` list,
- From the `Tasks` list, expand the `microej` list,
- Double-Click on `runOnDevice`.
- The device is flashed. Use the appropriate tool to retrieve the execution traces.

Alternative ways to run on device are described in the [Run on Device](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/runOnDevice.html) documentation.
