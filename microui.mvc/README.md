# Overview

This example shows how to create and use a MVC design pattern.

# Requirements

* MICROEJ SDK 6.
* A VEE Port that contains:
  * EDC-1.3 or higher.
  * BON-1.4 or higher.
  * MICROUI-3.6 or higher.

This example has been tested on:

- IntelliJ IDEA with MicroEJ plugin for IntelliJ IDEA ``1.1.0``.
- [NXP i.MX RT1170 VEE Port 3.0.0](https://github.com/MicroEJ/nxp-vee-imxrt1170-evk/tree/NXPVEE-MIMXRT1170-EVK-3.0.0).

# Usage

Follow [MICROEJ SDK 6 Installation Guide](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/install.html) to setup the SDK.

By default, the sample will use the
[NXP i.MX RT1170 VEE Port 3.0.0](https://github.com/MicroEJ/nxp-vee-imxrt1170-evk/tree/NXPVEE-MIMXRT1170-EVK-3.0.0).
The sample retrieves the VEE Port as a [module](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/selectVeePort.html#using-a-module-dependency).

Refer to the [Select a VEE Port](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/selectVeePort.html) 
documentation to use another VEE Port in your project.

## Run on Simulator

Run the following command in your IDE
(or click the ``Play`` button next to the line
below when opening this README in IntelliJ IDEA):

`./gradlew :microui.mvc:runOnSimulator`

Alternative ways to run in simulation are described in the [Run on Simulator](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/runOnSimulator.html) documentation.

## Run on Device

Complete the [Getting Started for NXP i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/gettingStartedIMXRT1170.html)
to make sure your environment is fully setup.

If you are using another VEE Port, make sure to properly setup the VEE Port environment
before going further. Refer to the dedicated VEE Port README or Getting Started for more information.

Run the following command in your IDE
(or click the ``Play`` button next to the line
